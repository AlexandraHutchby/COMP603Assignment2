HOW TO PLAY DEAL OR NO DEAL:

There are 25 cases to choose from, ranging from as low as $1 to as high as $1,000,000.
When prompted, pick a your case to get started.
In each round you are tasked to pick cases to eliminate - this removes the case from play
At the end of the round you will be given a bankers offer. 
You get to choose whether your sell your case for that amount of money.
Deal (Y) means that you get the bankers offer. No Deal (Any other key) means you continue playing
At the end of 8 rounds, two cases will remain (your case and another case)
You can choose to switch cases and win the prize in the other case. Or choose to stay with your case and win the prize in your case.

At the end of the game, you will be shown the remaining cases and their prizes. 
Your highest win prize will be saved against your username.
SORRY: You don't actually win anything. We're broke Uni students :)
