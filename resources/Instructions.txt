There are 26 cases to choose from, ranging from as low as $0.01 to as high $1,000,000.
When the game starts, you will be asked to select your case, you won't find out whats in it until the end.
In each round you are tasked to pick cases to eliminate - this removes the case from play
At the end of the round you will be given a bankers offer.
You get to choose whether you keep you case or take the bankers offer.
Deal means you take the bankers offer. No Deal means you keep on playing
At the end of 8 rounds, two cases will remain, your own and one more. 
You can choose to switch cases and win the prize in the other case. Or choose to stay with your case and win the prize in your case.

DISCLAIMER: You don't actually win anything. We're broke Uni students :)
